insertion in linked list

case1:insertion at begining     complexity:O(1) /independent of n
case2:insertion at inbetween    complexity:O(n) /dependent of n
case3:insertion at end          complexity:O(n) /dependent of n
case4:insertion after a node    complexity:O(1) /independent of n


deletion in linked list

case 1:deleting first node  complexity:O(1)
case 2:deleting a node in between
case 3:deleting the last node
case 4:delete a node with given value


why linked list?
memory and capacity of an aray remains fixed.In case of linked lists,we can keep adding and removing elements without
any capacity constraints.

drawbacks:
1.extra memory space for pointers is required
2.randon access not allowed as elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
